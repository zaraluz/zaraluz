### 👋 Hi, I'm Zara Louise!

I'm a **data-driven professional** with a background in **Business Administration** and a growing passion for **Data Analytics** and **Data Science**.  
My recent experience includes working as a **Business Data Analyst at SeguroBet**, where I developed interactive **Power BI dashboards**, automated data flows, and turned raw data into meaningful business insights.  
More recently, during my time as a **Data Warehousing Analyst in Germany**, I helped design and implement **data models**, optimize **ETL processes**, and build **database systems** to support smarter operational decisions.  

These experiences strengthened my analytical mindset and deepened my understanding of how data can drive both strategy and innovation.  

I’ve built strong skills in tools like **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **SQL**, and I’m expanding my expertise in **Python**, **statistics**, and **machine learning**.  
I love transforming complex data into **clear, actionable insights** that make a real impact.

Currently, I’m deepening my knowledge in **Data Science** — exploring how data can fuel innovation, efficiency, and better decision-making.  
I’m passionate about connecting analytical thinking with creativity, whether through data visualization, automation, or predictive modeling.

Outside of work, you’ll often find me exploring new datasets, learning new tools, or creating **handmade projects**, which remind me how rewarding it is to build things from scratch — in data and in life.  

📊 *Always curious, always learning — and always chasing the next insight.*
